# TheVerySpecialProject
This is our very special project, to create a zero to mastery developer survey web app. :)

**This project will be very different from all the other OpenSource projects we had in this community in many ways,**
**so you should be excited as well.**

**So you might be wondering, what is this project about ?**
_We will be having a Zero-To-Mastery developer survey, in order to understand each other better as a community,_
_and know everyone's backgrounds before having stepped into the vast universe of web development. With this data, we might_
_be better able to optimize the effectiveness of this community, and make the learning experience better for everyone._
**All the data will be collected anonymously (i.e. we don't know who you are, or where the data was sent from ), and it consists of data related to programming, and other non-sensitive data.**

**So now we know what the project is about, but what are we really gonna do for the project ?**
_As you might know, every survey needs the means and tools to collect the data in an efficient manner._
_And currently, we have no such tools. So We will be creating a web app that will have a very pretty interface,_
_that is easy to use, and a backend that will process all the data and ultimately store it in a database._
_This will cover all the topics that we took in this course, so it will be the perfect practice to hone our skills._

**So Samir, you said this project will be different from all other OpenSource Projects, but how really ?**
_In this project, we will form a solid team, and have our own Discord channel where we communicate ideas, distribute_
_tasks, and discuss the features we want to implement and how we will be going about it._
_The team will consist of 50 members max, in order to make management easier, and not end up with a chaotic project._
_If you missed your chance to become a member, don't worry, you can still make pull requests to our project, which_
_will be reviewed thoroughly to make sure that it is safe to merge. We will also have the features to be implemented_
_and the technologies to be used, written explicitly in the readme file of our project._

**So who will manage the project and how do I become a member ?**
_I will be leading this project from start to finish, even if I will have to do it all on my own ! XD_
